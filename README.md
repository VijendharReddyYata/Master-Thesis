Measurement of pores structural orientation from HR-pQCT images of human cortical bone: An auto-correlation based approach

- Matlab functions to extract the orientation of pores from CT data of human bone:
  - A function to extract the orientation of pores from an input cube in three different planes; YZ, XZ, and XY.
  - Another function to automatically extract the orientation of pores from CT data of big bone volume 
    - in a step length of 1 mm 
    - in three different planes (YZ, XZ, and XY) 

- Matlab code to verify the above-mentioned functions on in-silico data by creating some in-silico structures which resembles the HR-pQCT data of human cortical bone. 

- Matlab code for 3D image registration between HR-pQCT and SR micro-CT data of human femoral bone. 

- Matlab code to cross-validate the orientation extracted from HR-pQCT with the reference SR micro-CT data using the above-mentioned functions.
